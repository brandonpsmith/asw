              <h3>Brandon</h3>
              <p>Brandon is a developer and a nerd, a super dreamboat of a nerd. A total movie buff, lover of 80’s hair bands and Star Wars. Brandon is a man's man. Plaid wearing, beard sporting, non-hipster like, backpacking, knot tying enthusiast man's man. His dream is to grow up and be Bear Grills … or be on Naked and Afraid. I'm not sure who he loves more, me or our dogs. And I love that.</p>

              <h3>Brittney</h3>
              <p>If Brittney could only do one thing in life it would be snuggling and traveling the world. Her eye for fashion and throwing amazing parties are next to none. Flowers and chocolate are the way to her heart (watch out fools ... it only works if they are from me). She can school most people in lip sync battles and table top games (unless it's dominoes ... I always win). Brittney loves harder than anyone I know and I love her for it.</p>

                <p>Such a beautiful summer day - perfect for a date! Brandon picked me up in the cleanest truck I had ever seen! I asked him how he kept it so clean, especially with how outdoorsy he was! He then divulged that he had it detailed for our date. Cute, right?! It reminded me of a country song and I was really into it…a truck, having it detailed, my sundress, a lake.. yep, go ahead and make it a song Luke Bryan! We drove to Pops for a sweet tea (my favorite), bought cartons of soda’s and spent hours talking.<br><br>P.S. I was pretty much in love with her already - Brandon ;)</p>

                <p>Many of you saw, "liked" our pictures in the rain when Brandon asked me to be his bride. What you didn't know, is that my papa and my father used to run me out in the rain when there was a storm. I'd giggle my heart out and couldn't imagine a happier moment in life then running in and out of the rain with my Papa. He was so animated!<br><br>Then I grew up a little and runs in the rain became listening to the rain and old country music and I thought there couldn't be a happier moment in my life than soaking in this sweet time with my Papa.<br><br>I grew older. Sitting and listening to music became front porch sitting, welcoming the storm and talking about life and our dreams. How I dreamed of graduating college, of finding love, of adopting a million puppies. He told me of his dreams of owning land the whole family could live on, seeing me find a man who loved me as much as he did and more, of seeing us marry and him playing with his great grandbabies. There couldn't be a happier time in my life.<br><br>Before he left us, we sat on the back porch in lawn chairs, you guessed it, it was raining. He let me know how much he loved Brandon and thought he was such an amazing man. He said, "He's a serious man, but that's good. You're a silly girl. I can see he loves you. He's right for you."<br><br>On a cloudy day, Brandon picked me up and took me on a date. We went to Plenty and ran to the rooftop. He got down on one knee and asked me to marry him... It rained.<br><br>All of our dreams came true that day. Most brides don't dream of rain on their wedding day. I sit on the porch as the thunder rolls and welcome the rain with open arms and a happy heart knowing that it will be the happiest moment of my life; being showered in love.</p>

            <h4>What is a group gift?</h4>
            <p>A group gift is a great option for both couples and guests! The cost of a gift will be split between a designated number of guests. You can contribute 1 or more segments. When the gift has been fully funded we will alert the couple via email, and they will see your name as a contributor. If the gift is not fully funded, the money you contributed will be sent to them as a check in the mail. They will receive the full amount of your contribution.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="column">
            <h4>What is a cash registry?</h4>
            <p>Much like a money tree! Cash Registries are gifts where the couple has elected to receive cash value instead of a physical gift. Many couples prefer the flexibility of receiving cash so that they can apply the cash to a home down payment or a honeymoon. They will show how much can be contributed in a single segment, you may contribute more than once.</p>

          <div class="column">
            <h4>How do I mark a gift as Purchased?</h4>
            <p>Once a guest has completed their purchase for the couple's gift, these steps should be followed to update the registry:</p><p>Click the item on Blueprint Registry<br>Click the "Already purchased this gift?" link<br>Select if the gift was purchased online or in-store</p><p>For online purchases, please enter the order/confirmation number you receive from the retailer. Complete the form that appears.
Click the "Mark Gift As Purchased" button.</p>
